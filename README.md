# 🧠 LeetCode 75 – Data Structures & Algorithms Mastery

Welcome to my personal repository for solving the **LeetCode 75** curated list — a powerful roadmap of problems designed to build mastery in **Data Structures and Algorithms** (DSA), and to sharpen the mind for **technical interviews** and **real-world software engineering**.

---

## ✍️ Purpose

This project is more than code — it's a **discipline ritual**. I’m using it to:

- Deepen my understanding of DSA through deliberate practice.
- Strengthen my preparation for software engineering interviews (FAANG and beyond).
- Learn to recognize common problem-solving **patterns** (two pointers, sliding window, DFS/BFS, etc.).
- Improve code clarity, performance, and pattern fluency.

---

## 📘 Structure

Each problem includes:
- ✅ Problem name and number
- 🧠 Strategy explanation
- 🧪 My solution
- 🔍 Time and space complexity
- 💡 (When relevant) Alternate optimal solutions and deeper pattern discussion

## 🛠 Technologies

- **Language:** JavaScript (ES6+)
- **Platform:** [LeetCode.com](https://leetcode.com/problemset/all/)
- **Editor:** VSCode + ESLint
